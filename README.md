# My AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) Journey — Score: 857

- **Name**: Rubansi Vincent
- **Certification**: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP)
- **Date passed**: 05/08/2025
- **Score**: 857/1000
- **Study duration**: 7 weeks
- **Motivation**: Understand cloud computing concepts with regard to AWS
- **Starting point**: No IT background
- **Aspiration**: Learn how to deploy my projects on the cloud


## Overview

I completed the AWS CCP over 7 weeks, starting from no IT background. My goal was to build a strong foundation in AWS so I can confidently deploy and run my projects in the cloud. I combined structured coursework from ALX Bootcamp and AWS Academy with AWS Skill Builder, Udemy courses, Tutorials Dojo practice questions, and the official AWS documentation. Hands-on labs came from the ALX Bootcamp LMS.

## Learning Goals and Plan

- Primary goals
    - Grasp core AWS concepts and terminology
    - Understand global infrastructure and shared responsibility
    - Learn high-level use cases across compute, storage, databases, networking, security, cost, and monitoring
    - Gain practical confidence to deploy small apps to AWS

- Plan and cadence
    - Duration: 7 weeks
    - Structure: Theory during weekdays; hands-on labs and practice exams on weekends
    - Success criteria: Consistent improvement on practice questions; ability to explain service choices in plain language


## Resources Used

- ALX Bootcamp programs: Primary learning track with integrated hands-on labs via ALX LMS, Squad Projects, Expert Sessions, and Study Groups
- AWS Academy: Foundation modules aligned to the CCP exam blueprint
- AWS Skill Builder: Service overviews, exam prep pathways, and knowledge checks
- Udemy courses: Stephane Maarek: Comprehensive service coverage and exam focus
- Tutorials Dojo: Study notes and practice exams to calibrate exam readiness
- AWS Official Documentation: FAQs and product pages for authoritative clarifications (e.g., S3 storage classes, VPC components)

## Study Timeline

- Week 1: Cloud concepts, global infrastructure, shared responsibility
- Week 2: IAM fundamentals, MFA, Organizations, SCPs
- Week 3: Compute overview (EC2, Auto Scaling, ELB), Lambda, containers intro
- Week 4: Storage (S3 classes, lifecycle), EBS vs. EFS, Glacier basics
- Week 5: Databases (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora), caching with ElastiCache
- Week 6: Networking (VPCs, subnets, routing, SG vs. NACL), Route 53, CloudFront; Monitoring (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config)
- Week 7: Cost management (Budgets, Cost Explorer, pricing models, Savings Plans/RI), support plans; final review and mocks

## Topic Takeaways and Mental Models

- Cloud concepts:Regions vs. AZs vs. edge locations; elasticity and agility over capacity planning
- Security and identity: IAM; Users, roles, policies; MFA everywhere; Organizations + SCPs for guardrails
- Compute: EC2 for general compute, Auto Scaling + ELB for resilience; Lambda for event-driven bursts; ECS/Fargate for managed containers
- Storage: S3 as the “data lake” baseline; know the storage classes and retrieval times; EBS for block with EC2; EFS for shared POSIX
- Databases: RDS (managed relational) vs. DynamoDB (serverless key-value); Aurora for performance on relational workloads
- Networking and delivery: VPC isolation, subnets, SG vs. NACL; Route 53 for DNS; CloudFront for global caching and low latency
- Management and monitoring: CloudWatch for metrics/logs/alarms; CloudTrail for API audit; Config for compliance; Trusted Advisor for best-practice checks
- Cost and support: Tagging + Budgets + Cost Explorer; Pricing models; Savings Plans/RI for steady-state

## Tips for Future CCP Candidates

- Resources that worked for me
    - ALX + AWS Academy for structure
    - Udemy (Maarek, Dion) for varied explanations
    - Tutorials Dojo for exam calibration
    - AWS Skill builder
    - AWS docs/FAQs for authoritative clarity

- Time-savers and pitfalls
    - Build a service comparison cheat sheet early.

## What’s Next

- Apply CCP knowledge by deploying personal projects to AWS
    - Use AWS Lightsail to deploy wordpress websites
    - Use free tier resources and deploy websites on EC2 resources
- Learning roadmap
    - Next certifications of interest: Solutions Architect Associate
    - Deep dives: Design secure, resilient, high-performing, and cost-ptimized architectures
- Planned projects
    - [e.g., Serverless API with CI/CD, IaC with CloudFormation/Terraform, cost dashboard]
